        <p>Greater Canberra is a community advocacy group committed to affordable and high-quality housing in Canberra.</p>
        <p>Our members are a mix of renters and homeowners, at different stages of life and levels of wealth, and come from a variety of backgrounds and professions. What unites us is our commitment to the vision that by improving our housing policy and planning rules, we can make Canberra a more affordable, liveable, and sustainable city.</p>
        <p>We’re not a partisan group - our members come from many political parties, and we’ll work with anyone in politics committed to improving our housing situation. </p>
        <p>We have an open structure - anyone concerned with the state of housing in Canberra is welcome to join our community, contribute to the conversation, and help out with our campaigns and projects.</p>
